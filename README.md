## cd--change directory {This command is used for change the folder means -- divv-demo wlee folder se andr readme wle folder p aagyaa !!!}
## Now, clear command clears the terminal !!
## if we have to check that how many files in our folder then we do ls command means list files -- then open all the files having the folder !!

## but ls only shows local files but ls -a shows all the files (hidden files also) !!
